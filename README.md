# Codewars
Codewars (www.codewars.com) is a popular coding platform where programmers train on challenges known as Kata. These Katas test various coding skills and can be solved using a host of different programming skills. In this repository, I'll be uploading selected Katas that I have solved on Codewars and discussing how I could have completed them more efficiently.
